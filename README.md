# Electronics experiments (once Raspberry Pi experiments)

This repo contains some of my tests and experiments that I have the time to do
with my Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards and some electronics.


I'm not an expert. I do this just for fun and to learn something new.


## Repo structure

Inside the `experiments` folder there is the main separation of the projects
based on the board used in them:

- arduino
- rpi
